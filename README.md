# 👋 Hi, I'm Facundo Fernandez

💻 **QA Tester | Aspiring Software Developer | Tech Enthusiast**

Since I was a kid, I've been passionate about computers and technology.  
Working in QA helped me develop a strong analytical mindset, attention to detail, and a real appreciation for clean, efficient code.  

I'm currently learning and building projects to grow as a **software developer**, while keeping my focus on **quality and user experience**.  

### 🧠 What I enjoy
- Solving problems and learning new technologies  
- Automating tests and improving workflows  
- Exploring software design and development best practices  
- Building useful tools and fun side projects  

### 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, Java, C, C# (learning), SQL, Javascript   
- **Tools:** Git, VS Code, Android Studio, Postman, Microsoft SQL Server, MySql, MongoDB  
- **Interests:** Software testing, automation, full stack development, and Android apps  

### 🚀 Current project
I'm developing **[DiviGastos](#)** — an Android app that helps friends split expenses easily, track who paid what, and share the final summary.  
It's built with **Kotlin** and **Android Studio**, and I'm planning to integrate **Mercado Pago**.

### 🌱 Currently learning
- Android app architecture (MVVM, Room, LiveData)  
- QA automation tools and practices  
- Clean code and design patterns in C#
